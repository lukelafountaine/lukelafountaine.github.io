I attended my first hackathon over this past weekend at the UC Berkeley campus. With a team that I met at the event, we built and Android app that helps you to get the most out of the movie watching experience. 
We won for the best music/video app using the GraceNote API, which came as a surprise to the team. It was a great time. 
I learned a lot, and I would definitely do it again.
