I have not posted much besides travel photos on here so far, so here is something tech related.

When searching for certain technical things on Google, such as Java or Python programming stuff, this box opens up:

The challenges are a series of 5 levels of programming questions. There is 1 question for level 1, 2 for level 2 and so on, totaling 15 questions. They get progressively more difficult as you advance through the levels. I am currently working on question 2 of level 5, and it's got me pretty stumped. 

A lot of the questions are pretty math heavy, so it's been a good exercise for winter break. Anyways, I've had a good time working on them. Just another reason why I love Google.
